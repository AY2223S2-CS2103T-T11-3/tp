### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Event` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Event` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### New Contact feature

### Implementation

The new contact feature is facilitated by the `Contact` class. `Contact` class encapsulates the two attributes of a contact with the help of the `ContactName` and `ContactPhone` class.
A new contact created will be added to the contact list which will be saved in a JSON file.

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How new contact is created:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new contact through creating `ContactName` and `ContactPhone` attributes.
    * Pros: More levels of abstraction to prevent the accidental change of information.
    * Cons: Complicated code.
* **Alternative 2:** Created a new contact through storing strings input by user.
    * Pros: Easy to code.
    * Cons: Might be hard to keep track or do comparisons with.
  

### Mark feature
The mark feature mechanism is implemented by having the Event class keep track of an additional attribute called 'Mark'. When an event is completed, the event will be marked through the class attribute 'Mark'.

**Implementation design**: The feature is implemented with a seperate class 'Mark' instead of a 'isDone' boolean attribute. This ensures that there is a greater abstraction and allows for further development if we wish to further develop the application to keep track of other milestones.

### Unmark feature

The `unmark` feature allows for unmarking of the 'Mark' attribute in events should there be an accidental marking of an event.

#### Implementation

The `unmark` feature is implemented with the following considerations:

- A valid `index` will be taken in as a parameter to facilitate unmarking of the correct event.
- The unmark feature builds alongside the existing implementation of the 'Mark' class.
- Allows for undo of accidental marking by setting the 'isDone' boolean attribute of the 'Mark' class to false to signify an undone event.
- Unmarking of an undone event would not result in error or exceptions as this action does not reduce correctness of presented information.

#### Design considerations:  

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Calls on `unmark` method in 'Mark' class to set the tracked boolean variable 'isDone' to false** 
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Results in higher coupling as it is editing a variable in an event instance, may lead to errors in runtime and testing.

* **Alternative 2: Replace current instance of specified event with a new unmarked event instance**
  * Pros: Results in less coupling and in turn lower possibility of unintended change cascades.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage and runtime.

### Reminder feature

#### Implementation

The reminder feature is facilitated by `StartTimeWithinDaysPredicate`, that tests if ane event is within the given days.

The current time is determined by a `Clock` that is created by `LogicManager`. The `LogicManager` creates an `EventBookParser` with `Clock` as an attribute. When parsing a remind command, the `EventBookParser` creates a `RemindCommandParser` with the `Clock` as an attribute.

The `RemindCommandParser` checks if the command argument has the correct format. The command argument represents days and should be a positive integer. `RemindCommandParser` creates a `RemindCommand` with a `StartTimeWithinDaysPredicate`, that uses the `Clock` to get the current time. The `StartTimeWithinDaysPredicate` tests if a given event's start date is within the inputted days of the current time.

The `RemindCommand` is then executed by `LogicManager`. After testing all events with the `StartTimeWithinDaysPredicate`, filtered events are displayed.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How current time is determined:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Determine current time using a `Clock` created in `LogicManager`.
    * Pros: Easy to test. A fixed `Clock` can be created.
    * Cons: Coupling between classes that use `Clock`, even if the class only uses it to create an object that uses `Clock`

* **Alternative 2:** Determine current time using `LocalDateTime.now()` in `StartTimeWithinDaysPredicate`.
    * Pros: Less coupling between classes.
    * Cons: Difficult to test, as the current time is based on real time.


### Linkcontact feature

The link contact feature allows users to link a contact to an event.

#### Implementation
The `linkcontact` feature is facilitated by `Event` class.
The feature is implemented as follows:
* When a user adds an event, he can optionally add a contact to the event.
* When a user edits an event, he can optionally add a contact to the event.
* When a user edits an event, he can optionally change the contact of the event.
* If the user specifies a contact that does not exist in the contact list, the event will not be added/edited.
* If the user specifies a contact that already exists in the contact list, the event will be added/edited with the contact.

The linkcontact feature will take in a contact number as a parameter. This parameter will be used to search for the contact in the contact list.
1. If the contact is found, the contact will be linked to the event.
2. If the contact is not found, the event will not be added/edited.

#### Design consideration:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a `Contact` attribute to `Event` class.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May violate Single Responsibility Principle as `Event` class now has to handle both event and contact.
* **Alternative 2:** Add the `contact` as just a normal string attribute to `Event` class.
    * Pros: Even easier to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to implement filtering of events by contact in the future.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th event in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new event. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the event was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the event being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
