Welcome to the Paidlancers User Guide! We're thrilled to have you here! At Paidlancers,
we know that freelancing can be both rewarding and challenging. As freelancers ourselves, we understand the unique
obstacles and opportunities that come with freelancing. That's why we created Paidlancers – a desktop app
designed to help you streamline your freelancing event management tasks.

## Introducing Paidlancers

Paidlancers is a **desktop app for keeping track of your freelancing events, optimised for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
Paidlancers can get your freelancing event management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This user guide will help you get up to speed in no time!

    * 23-03-2023 the whole day
    * 24-03-2023 the whole day
  - Note that 24-03-2023 is within 2 days of 22-03-2023, so events on 24-03-2023 that start more than 48 hours from the current date and time are displayed.
