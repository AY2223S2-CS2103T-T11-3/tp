### Project: Paidlancers

Paidlancers is a **desktop app for keeping track of your freelancing events, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Paidlancers can get your freelancing event management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
