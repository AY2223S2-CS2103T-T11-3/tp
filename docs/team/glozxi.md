### Project: Paidlancers

Paidlancers is a **desktop app for keeping track of your freelancing events, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Paidlancers can get your freelancing event management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added start and end timing to events.
  * What it does: Start and end timing of events are displayed in the GUI. Allows the user to add start and end date and time to an event when creating it. The user can edit start and end timings.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product signficantly because our target user is a freelancer, who needs to know when their events start and end.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing features to add and edit events. It also affects current and future features that use event timings. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view upcoming events.
  * What it does: Allows the user to use a command to view events starting within a specified number of days.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product signficantly because the user would want to know what events to prepare for. 
  * Highlights: This enchancement required a way to get the current date and time. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives for a testable and useful implementation.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=glozxi&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
