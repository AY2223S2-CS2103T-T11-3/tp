### Project: Paidlancers

Paidlancers is a **desktop app for keeping track of your freelancing events, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Paidlancers can get your freelancing event management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a start and end timing to events.
  * What it does: allows the user to add start and end date and time to an event when creating it. The user can edit start and end timings.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product signficantly because our target user is a freelancer, who needs to know when their events start and end.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing features to add and edit events. It also affects current and future features that use event timings.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=glozxi&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
